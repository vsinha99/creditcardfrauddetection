# creditcardfrauddetection
A program that uses machine learning techniques to determine the validity of credit card transactions

This Kaggle dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This program uses the logistic regression algorithm by Anaconda, a data science oriented Python interpreter. Logistic regression can be defined as a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to find the relationships between two data factors; it then uses this relationship to predict the value of one of those factors based on the other. This program creates a sample dataset from the one given to train a model. This model is then tested on both the created dataset and the actual dataset, printing the accuracy of both.
